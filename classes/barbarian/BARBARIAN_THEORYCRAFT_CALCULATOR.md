## 🎯 Optimal Builds by Point Count

### **14 Points: Gate Rush (Minimum)**

**Allocation:**
- 14 normal nodes: Path to gate

**Stats:**
- ~70 primary stats (mixed Str/Dex/Will/Int)
- Gate unlocked ✅

**Value Score:** 14 points
**Best For:** Speed to legendary boards
**Next Step:** Attach legendary board immediately

---

### **24 Points: Gate + 1 Rare**

**Allocation:**
- 14 nodes: Path to gate
- 8 nodes: Path to Brawn rare
- 1 node: Brawn rare
- 1 node: 1 magic node if on path

**Stats:**
- ~120 primary stats (mixed)
- +20% Damage (Brawn)
- +4% Life (Brawn)
- Gate unlocked ✅

**Value Score:** 14 + 10 + 40 = 64 points (2.67x efficiency!)
**Best For:** Early damage spike while unlocking legendary

---

### **36 Points: Gate + 2 Rares (OPTIMAL)**

**Allocation:**
- 14 nodes: Path to gate
- 6 nodes: Path to Brawn
- 1 node: Brawn rare
- 6 nodes: Path to Tenacity
- 1 node: Tenacity rare
- 8 nodes: Fill magic nodes + glyph socket area

**Stats:**
- ~160-180 primary stats (mixed Str/Dex/Will/Int)
- +20% Damage (Brawn)
- +8% Life (Brawn + Tenacity)
- +2% Armor (Tenacity)
- +10-20% additional from magic nodes if allocated
- Gate unlocked ✅

**Value Score:** 14 + 16 + 40 + 12 + ~20 = 102+ points (2.83x efficiency!)
**Best For:** Balanced power + survivability + legendary access

---

### **50 Points: Gate + All 4 Rares**

**Allocation:**
- 14 nodes: Path to gate
- 8 nodes: Paths to Brawn + Tenacity
- 2 nodes: Brawn + Tenacity rares
- 12 nodes: Path to Raw Power (past gate)
- 1 node: Raw Power rare
- 8 nodes: Path to Iron Strength
- 1 node: Iron Strength rare
- 4 nodes: Fill magic nodes

**Stats:**
- ~250 primary stats (mixed)
- +40% Damage (Brawn + Raw Power)
- +30% Elite Damage (Iron Strength)
- +8% Life (Brawn + Tenacity)
- +2% Armor (Tenacity)
- +10 Strength (Raw Power + Iron Strength)
- Gate unlocked ✅

**Value Score:** 14 + 26 + 40 + 12 + 42 + 62 + ~20 = 216 points (4.32x efficiency!)
**Best For:** Maximum starting board value before going to legendary boards

---

## 📈 Efficiency Comparison

| Points | Rares | Value Score | Efficiency | Recommendation |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 14 | 0 | 14 | 1.00x | Speed runner only |
| 24 | 1 | 64 | 2.67x | Good early power |
| **36** | **2** | **102** | **2.83x** | **OPTIMAL** ⭐ |
| 50 | 4 | 216 | 4.32x | Best if you have points |
| 75 | 4 | 250+ | 3.33x | Diminishing returns |

**Sweet Spot:** **36 points** - Best efficiency without overinvesting in starting board

## 🎲 Alternative 36-Point Builds

### **Option A: Damage Focused (Current Recommendation)**
- Brawn + Tenacity rares
- Focus magic nodes with damage
- **Result:** +20-30% Damage, +8% Life, +2% Armor

### **Option B: Skip Tenacity for More Fill**
- Brawn only
- 14 more normal/magic nodes
- **Result:** +20% Damage, +4% Life, +70 more stats

### **Option C: Rush past gate to Raw Power**
- Gate + Raw Power rare
- Skip Brawn/Tenacity
- **Result:** +20% Damage, +10 Str, but harder pathing

**Verdict:** Option A (current) is optimal - gets 2 rares on efficient path to gate

## 🔬 Theorycraft Notes

**Rare Node ROI:**
- Each rare = 40-60 normal nodes worth of value
- With 36 points, grabbing 2 rares = 80-100 nodes worth in just 2 points!
- Remaining 34 points for pathing = excellent efficiency

**Magic Node ROI:**
- +10% Damage magic = 20 normal nodes worth
- If you can grab 2-3 magic nodes on your path, do it!
- They're blue - watch for them

**Stat Distribution:**
- 36 points ≈ 55% Strength, 22% Dex, 20% Will, 3% Int
- This is GOOD - you get secondary stats for rare bonuses
- Don't worry about "wasted" points on non-Strength nodes

**Glyph Socket:**
- Nodes within radius get glyph bonuses
- Worth filling 6-8 nodes around socket
- Different glyphs = different bonuses (swap as needed)

---

## 💡 Custom Point Calculations

**Want a different point count? Use this formula:**

**Minimum (reach gate):** 14 points
**Per rare node:** +7 points average (6 path + 1 rare)
**Fill nodes:** remaining points

**Examples:**
- 20 points = Gate + partial rare path (not recommended - finish the rare!)
- 30 points = Gate + 2 rares + minimal fill ✅
- 36 points = Gate + 2 rares + good fill ✅ **OPTIMAL**
- 42 points = Gate + 2 rares + magic nodes + glyph fill
- 50 points = Gate + all 4 rares (backtracking required)
