# Barbarian 36-Point Build - Strategy Guide

## ⚠️ Important Note

I cannot provide exact "node 1, node 2, node 3" directions because:
- Wowhead coordinate data doesn't match in-game visual positions
- The board layout in-game is not a simple grid
- Nodes branch in multiple directions (not straight up)

**Instead, use this STRATEGY GUIDE** while navigating the board visually yourself.

## 🎯 Your 36-Point Strategy

### **Goal 1: Reach the GATE (Top of Board)**
**Points needed:** ~15 nodes

**How:**
- Start at the starting node (bottom center)
- Build a connected path going TOWARD the top
- Each node you allocate must TOUCH a node you already allocated
- Follow the CENTER of the board (stay in the middle, don't go to far edges)
- You'll see the path naturally form going upward
- Stop when you reach the GATE node at the top

**What you'll get:**
- Gate unlocked (can attach legendary boards)
- ~75 total primary stats (mixed Str/Dex/Will/Int)

---

### **Goal 2: Allocate BRAWN Rare Node**
**Points needed:** ~6 additional nodes (21 total so far)

**How to find BRAWN:**
- **Visual:** GOLD/ORANGE node (very obvious, different from brown common nodes)
- **Name:** Hover over it - tooltip will say "Brawn"
- **Stats:** Tooltip shows `+20.0% Damage` and `+4.0% Maximum Life`
- **Location:** In the lower area of the board, should be visible from your starting path

**How to allocate:**
- From your allocated path (the 15 nodes to gate), find which node is CLOSEST to Brawn
- Build a connected path from that node to Brawn
- Each node must touch the previous one
- Allocate Brawn rare node when you reach it

**What you'll get:**
- +20% Damage bonus
- +4% Maximum Life

---

### **Goal 3: Allocate TENACITY Rare Node**
**Points needed:** ~6 additional nodes (27 total so far)

**How to find TENACITY:**
- **Visual:** GOLD/ORANGE node (another rare)
- **Name:** Hover over it - tooltip will say "Tenacity"
- **Stats:** Tooltip shows `+4.0% Maximum Life` and `+2.0% Total Armor`
- **Location:** In the lower area of the board, near Brawn

**How to allocate:**
- From your allocated nodes (including Brawn), find which is CLOSEST to Tenacity
- Build a connected path to Tenacity
- Each node must touch the previous one
- Allocate Tenacity rare node when you reach it

**What you'll get:**
- +4% Maximum Life
- +2% Total Armor

---

### **Goal 4: Fill to 36 Points**
**Points needed:** 9 more nodes (36 total)

**What to allocate:**
1. **Nodes around the GLYPH SOCKET** (red circle in center of board)
   - Glyphs boost nodes in their radius
   - Allocating near the socket = better bonuses

2. **Efficient connectors**
   - Connect your rare nodes to your main path
   - Fill any gaps in your allocation

3. **Any remaining touching nodes**
   - Just make sure they touch your allocated nodes

**What you'll get:**
- ~45 additional stats (mixed)
- Better glyph socket coverage

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

**When you've allocated all 36 points, you should have:**

✅ Gate at top - UNLOCKED
✅ Brawn rare node - ALLOCATED (gold node, +20% Damage, +4% Life)
✅ Tenacity rare node - ALLOCATED (gold node, +4% Life, +2% Armor)
✅ All nodes form ONE connected path (no isolated nodes)
✅ Some nodes around glyph socket (red circle)

## 🎮 How to Use This Guide

1. Open Diablo 4 and go to your paragon board
2. Have this guide open on another screen/device
3. Follow the 4 goals in order
4. Use tooltips to identify rare nodes (look for gold nodes with "Brawn" and "Tenacity" names)
5. Build connected paths - every node must touch
6. Verify checklist when done

---

## 💡 Why This Approach Works

**Instead of saying "allocate node at position (X,Y)":**
- I tell you WHAT to look for (gold rare nodes)
- I tell you the GOAL (reach gate, get 2 rares)
- I tell you the RULE (nodes must touch)
- YOU navigate using the visual board you see in-game

This works because:
- You can see the actual board layout
- Tooltips show you exact stats
- Rare nodes are visually obvious (gold color + names)
- You can verify each allocation

**This guide gives you the strategy - you execute it with the visual info in-game!**
