# Barbarian 36-Point Build - Exact Step-by-Step Guide

## 🎯 Goal
Build a connected path from START to GATE (top), grabbing Brawn and Tenacity rare nodes along the way.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES

1. **Nodes must TOUCH** - You can only allocate nodes adjacent to already-allocated nodes
2. **Check tooltips** - Hover over each node to verify the stat before allocating
3. **Follow the sequence** - Allocate in the order below to ensure path stays connected

---

## 📝 Exact Allocation Sequence

### **Part 1: Starting Nodes (Nodes 1-3)**

**Node 1: STARTING NODE** (Already allocated automatically)
- Location: Center bottom of board
- Tooltip: Paragon Starting Node
- This is your anchor point

**Node 2: First node above start**
- Direction: Directly ABOVE the starting node
- Look for: Node touching the top of starting node
- Tooltip shows: `+5 Strength` (based on your screenshot)
- ✅ Allocate this

**Node 3: Continue upward**
- Direction: ABOVE node 2 (continue in same upward direction)
- Look for: Node touching the top of node 2
- Tooltip shows: Check in-game (likely `+5 Strength` or another stat)
- ✅ Allocate this

---

### **Part 2: Main Path to Gate (Nodes 4-15)**

**Continue the pattern:**

**Nodes 4-15:** Keep allocating nodes going UPWARD toward the gate
- Each node must TOUCH the previous node
- Stay in the CENTER column (don't branch to sides yet)
- Hover over each node to see what stat it gives
- You'll see a mix: Strength, Dexterity, Willpower, Intelligence (+5 each)
- Continue until you reach the **GATE** node at the top

**Gate node (Node ~15):**
- Location: Top of the starting board
- Icon: Should have a special gate/door appearance
- This unlocks legendary board attachment
- ✅ Allocate this

**Stats so far:** ~75 total stats (mixed Str/Dex/Will/Int from the 15 nodes)

---

### **Part 3: Find BRAWN Rare Node (Nodes 16-21)**

**Look for BRAWN rare node:**
- Visual: **GOLD/ORANGE node** (stands out from brown common nodes)
- Name in tooltip: **"Brawn"**
- Tooltip shows: `+20% Damage` and `+4% Maximum Life`
- Location: Lower area of board, near your starting path

**How to reach it:**

**From your main path, find which node is closest to Brawn**
- Look at your allocated path from steps 1-15
- Find where Brawn is in relation to your path
- Brawn should be within 2-4 nodes of your main path

**Allocate connecting nodes:**
- From your main path, allocate nodes that TOUCH your path
- Work toward Brawn (each node must touch the previous)
- Keep allocating until you can allocate Brawn itself
- Estimate: 5-6 nodes total including Brawn

**Node ~21: BRAWN (rare)**
- ✅ Allocate this rare node
- Bonus: +20% Damage, +4% Maximum Life

**Stats so far:** ~105 total stats + 20% Damage + 4% Life

---

### **Part 4: Find TENACITY Rare Node (Nodes 22-27)**

**Look for TENACITY rare node:**
- Visual: **GOLD/ORANGE node** (another rare)
- Name in tooltip: **"Tenacity"**
- Tooltip shows: `+4% Maximum Life` and `+2% Total Armor`
- Location: Lower area of board, should be near Brawn

**How to reach it:**

**From your allocated path (including Brawn), find Tenacity**
- Tenacity should be close to your current allocation
- Work toward it from your nearest allocated node

**Allocate connecting nodes:**
- From your path, allocate nodes touching your allocated nodes
- Work toward Tenacity (each must touch the previous)
- Keep allocating until you reach Tenacity
- Estimate: 5-6 nodes total including Tenacity

**Node ~27: TENACITY (rare)**
- ✅ Allocate this rare node
- Bonus: +4% Maximum Life, +2% Total Armor

**Stats so far:** ~135 total stats + 20% Damage + 8% Life + 2% Armor

---

### **Part 5: Fill Remaining Nodes (Nodes 28-36)**

**Allocate 9 more nodes for maximum efficiency:**

**Where to allocate:**
1. **Around the Glyph Socket** (red circle in center of board)
   - Allocating nodes near glyph gives bonus effects
   - Look for nodes within 2-3 spaces of the glyph socket

2. **Fill gaps in your path**
   - Connect Brawn and Tenacity to your main path efficiently
   - Fill any isolated pockets of nodes you can reach

3. **Prioritize**:
   - Nodes touching the glyph socket (bonus effects)
   - Nodes that connect your rare nodes to main path
   - Any remaining nodes touching your allocation

**Rule:** Every node must still TOUCH an already-allocated node!

**Nodes 28-36:** Allocate 9 more nodes following the above priorities

**Final stats:** ~160-180 total stats + all rare bonuses

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After allocating all 36 nodes, verify:

- [ ] GATE is allocated (top of board) ✅
- [ ] BRAWN rare node is allocated (gold node, check tooltip for name) ✅
- [ ] TENACITY rare node is allocated (gold node, check tooltip for name) ✅
- [ ] All 36 nodes form ONE connected path (no isolated nodes) ✅
- [ ] Nodes around glyph socket are allocated (red circle) ✅

## 🎨 Visual Identification Guide

**What to look for:**

| Node Type | Visual | What to Do |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Common** | Brown/bronze circular icon | Allocate to build path |
| **Magic** | Blue circular icon | Slightly better stats |
| **Rare** | **GOLD/ORANGE with name** | **Target these! Brawn + Tenacity** |
| **Glyph Socket** | Red circle in center | Allocate nodes around it |
| **Gate** | Special gate icon at top | Must reach to attach legendary |

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Hover before allocating** - Tooltip shows exact stat (+5 Strength, etc.)
2. **Rare nodes are obvious** - They're gold and have names in tooltip
3. **Path must connect** - If you can't allocate a node, you're not touching it
4. **Glyph socket** - Allocate nodes in its radius for extra bonuses
5. **Respec is free** - Made a mistake? Reset and try again

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Your allocation order:**
1. Start → Gate (center path upward, ~15 nodes)
2. Main path → Brawn (find gold "Brawn" node, ~6 nodes)
3. Main path → Tenacity (find gold "Tenacity" node, ~6 nodes)
4. Fill around glyph socket (~9 nodes)

**Total:** 36 connected nodes
**Result:** Gate unlocked + 2 best accessible rare nodes + balanced stats
