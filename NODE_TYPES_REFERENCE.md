## 🔴 Glyph Socket

**Visual:** Red circular socket in center of board

**Purpose:**
- Insert glyphs here
- Glyphs boost nodes within their radius
- Different glyphs provide different bonuses

**Note:** Not a node you allocate - it's a socket for glyph items

## 📊 Node Value Comparison

| Node Type | Example Bonus | Value vs Normal Node |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Normal** | +5 Strength | 1x (baseline) |
| **Magic** | +10% Damage | ~20x better! |
| **Rare** | +20% Damage + 4% Life | ~40x better! |

**Takeaway:** Magic and Rare nodes are SIGNIFICANTLY more valuable than normal nodes!

## 🎯 Node Priority for Builds

### **For 36-Point Build:**

**Must Have:**
1. Gate node (unlocks legendary boards)
2. 2 Rare nodes - **Brawn** and **Tenacity** (accessible from start)

**Nice to Have:**
3. Magic nodes (blue) - grab if on your path
4. Normal nodes - only to connect paths

**Skip (for 36pts):**
- Raw Power rare (too far/past gate)
- Iron Strength rare (too far/past gate)
- Normal nodes far from your path

## 🔍 Rare Node Bonus Thresholds

**To unlock rare node BONUS effects:**

| Rare Node | Base Bonus | Threshold Needed | Bonus Effect |
|-----------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Brawn** | +20% Dmg, 4% Life | 630 Strength | +20% Damage again (40% total!) |
| **Tenacity** | 4% Life, 2% Armor | 630 Str + 190 Will | +4% Life again (8% total!) |
| **Raw Power** | +20% Dmg, +10 Str | 190 Dexterity | +20% Damage again (40% total!) |
| **Iron Strength** | +30% Elite Dmg, +10 Str | 190 Willpower | +30% Elite Dmg again (60% total!) |

**Reality Check:**
- With 36 points: You get BASE bonuses only (can't hit 630 Str or 190 secondary stats)
- With 100+ points across multiple boards: You might hit some thresholds
- Thresholds are endgame goals, not something to worry about at 36 points

---

## 💡 Using This Information

**When building your 36-point allocation:**

1. **Prioritize reaching the GATE** - 15 normal nodes
2. **Grab accessible RARE nodes** - Brawn + Tenacity (2 nodes)
3. **Take MAGIC nodes** if they're on your path (blue nodes)
4. **Fill with normal nodes** to connect everything (19 nodes)

**Total:** 36 nodes = Gate + 2 Rares + Magic if available + Normal connectors
